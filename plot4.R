## Function:	plot4.R function()

## Assignment Description:
#
# Using NEI data for 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008 - address the following 
# question
#
#	"Across the United States, how have emissions from coal 
#	combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
#	Upload a PNG file containing your plot addressing this question."
#
# Plot is to be saved as png named "plot4.png"
