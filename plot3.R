## Function:	plot3.R function()
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------
## Assignment Description:
#
# Using NEI data for 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008 - address the following 
# question
#
#	"Of the four types of sources indicted by the "type" (point, 
#	nonnpoint, onroad, offraod) variable,, which of these four 
#	sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999 to 2008 for
#	Baltimire City?  Which have seen increases in emissions from
#	1999-2008? 
#
# 	Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answering this
#	question."
#
# Plot is to be saved as png named "plot3.png"
